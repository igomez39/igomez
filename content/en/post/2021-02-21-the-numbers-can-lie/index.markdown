In the introduction of the book *Data Feminism*[^1] we learn about the story of Christine Darden – an African American woman who worked in NASA during the *Apollo II* mission. During her time in NASA, Darden noticed the sexism that existed in the workplace, specifically that women and men with the same qualification did not get equal recognition. Fortunately, Gloria Champine, another NASA employee, had collected data about gender and rank, which confirmed (with numbers) the lived experience of Darden. These statistics changed the professional trajectory of Darden. This demonstrates how statistics can be a tool for activism. However, it is important to note that Champine and Darden shared an identity --- being women at NASA, the same identity that at that time needed the data to see change. This highlights how the identities of the people conducting research may influence the data collection methods, the analysis, and the presentation of the data, which are factors in the social impact of the analysis. 

In 2019, the Attorney General office of the Dominican Republic (PGR) reported that the rate of femicides decreased by 25%, a decrease they attributed to a change in [machismo culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machismo) in the Dominican Republic.[^2] The United Nation's Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) reported their own statistics which showed an increase in the femicide rate in the Dominican Republic. 

The discrepancies in the statistics came from a difference in the definition of femicide. The PGR changed their definition of femicide to only count the murder of a woman committed by an intimate partner as femicide, while CEPAL defines femicide more broadly as homicides of women killed by gender violence. This difference in definition resulted in the PGR only counting 66 femicides and not the 114 women who were murdered in 2019.[^3] 


This is a clear example of how identities (in this particular case, the identities of the organizations themselves and individuals in them) can influence the story told with the same data, especially when there is no universal consensus on how to report a specific statistic. We can see the potential social impact statistics can have, specifically on the resources available to address the issue at hand. Conversely, we also see how statistics can maintain the oppressive system in place with the façade that there is actual progress. This example serves as a warning of how my own identities can bias analysis. Additionally, it serves as a reminder on the importance of consulting with members of the community impacted by my research to ensure an accurate representation of the data.
